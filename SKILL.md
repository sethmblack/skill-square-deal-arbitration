# Square Deal Arbitration

Adjudicate disputes or design policies that achieve genuine fairness without favoritism or class warfare, using Theodore Roosevelt's Square Deal framework.

---

## When to Use

- Mediating disputes between parties with competing interests
- Designing policies or systems that affect multiple stakeholders
- Assessing whether a situation or arrangement is genuinely fair
- Deciding how to allocate resources, opportunities, or burdens
- Responding to claims of unfairness or favoritism
- User asks "Square deal analysis" or "How do I be fair to all parties?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The dispute, policy question, or fairness assessment needed |
| parties | No | The stakeholders with competing interests |
| current_arrangement | No | How things are currently structured |
| complaints | No | Specific claims of unfairness being made |

## Roosevelt's Framework

### The Square Deal Principle
"When I say I believe in a square deal I do not mean to give every man the best hand. If the cards do not come to any man, or if they do come, and he has not got the power to play them, that is his affair. All I mean is that there shall be no crookedness in the dealing."

### Core Elements

**1. No Crookedness in the Dealing**
- Rules must be applied consistently
- No hidden advantages for favored parties
- No manipulation of the process
- Transparency in how decisions are made

**2. Equal Opportunity, Not Equal Outcome**
- Everyone gets a fair chance to compete
- Results depend on effort, skill, and circumstances
- No guarantee of success, only guarantee of honest treatment
- Merit matters; mere equality of outcome is not the goal

**3. No Favoritism**
- The powerful cannot buy special treatment
- The weak cannot claim special treatment merely for being weak
- Each party judged by the same standards
- Relationships and status do not affect fair dealing

**4. No Class Warfare**
- Neither side demonized for its position
- Legitimate interests of all parties acknowledged
- Resolution, not victory of one class over another
- The goal is workable arrangement, not punishment

---

## Assessment Criteria

### Signs of a Square Deal
- Rules applied consistently to all parties
- Each party had opportunity to be heard
- Decision-making criteria are transparent
- Outcome reflects legitimate considerations, not favoritism
- All parties can see the fairness even if they dislike the result

### Signs of Crookedness
- Different rules for different parties
- Hidden advantages or back-channel dealing
- Decision-making opaque or post-hoc rationalized
- Outcome systematically favors one party regardless of merit
- Process manipulated to ensure predetermined result

### Signs of Class Warfare (Opposite Error)
- One party demonized as inherently illegitimate
- Assumption that power or success indicates wrongdoing
- Outcomes designed to punish rather than balance
- Zero-sum framing where one party must lose entirely
- Moralization that prevents practical resolution

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Constraints

- Fairness is not the same as equality of outcome
- Legitimate differences in contribution, risk, and circumstance justify different outcomes
- This framework addresses fair dealing, not charity or compassion (which may be warranted separately)
- Some situations have no "fair" resolution—someone must lose; the goal is honest process
- The framework assumes good-faith disagreement; bad actors require different tools

## Example

**Input:** "Two salespeople are fighting over commission on a big deal. Alice worked with the client for 6 months. Bob closed the deal after she went on medical leave. Both claim full commission. How do I resolve this fairly?"

**Output:**

## Square Deal Assessment

### The Situation
A dispute over sales commission between two salespeople. Alice cultivated the relationship over 6 months. Bob closed the deal during her medical leave. Both claim full commission. The total commission is substantial, making this a significant issue.

### The Parties and Their Interests

**Alice:**
- Legitimate interest: She invested 6 months of relationship-building and education that made the deal possible
- Her claim: Without her work, there would be no deal to close
- What she risks losing: Reward for months of effort taken by someone who arrived at the end

**Bob:**
- Legitimate interest: He closed the deal, handled final negotiations, and got the signature
- His claim: Closing is what generates revenue; cultivation means nothing without conversion
- What he risks losing: Reward for the actual revenue-generating action

**The Company:**
- Legitimate interest: Fair system that incentivizes both cultivation AND closing
- Risk: Whatever decision creates precedent for future disputes

### Current Arrangement Analysis
**What's working:** Your commission structure presumably rewards results (revenue)
**What's crooked:** If full commission goes to Bob, the system punishes cultivation. If full commission goes to Alice, it punishes closing. Either extreme is unfair.
**Relevant factor:** Alice's absence was medical leave—an involuntary circumstance, not abandonment.

### The Square Deal Standard
**What fairness requires here:** Recognition that BOTH activities contributed to the result. Neither should receive nothing; neither should receive everything. The deal was a relay race, not a solo sprint.

**What fairness does NOT require:**
- Equal 50/50 split (their contributions may not have been equal)
- Full commission to whoever "feels" more wronged
- Precedent that medical leave forfeits earned opportunity

### Assessment of Complaints

**Alice's grievance—LEGITIMATE:**
She did 6 months of work. Bob did the final weeks/days. If she receives nothing, the message is that cultivation doesn't matter—only closing. This would be crooked dealing: it would mean different rules apply depending on timing of medical events.

**Bob's grievance—PARTIALLY LEGITIMATE:**
He did close the deal. Closing requires skill and effort. He should not receive nothing. However, his implicit claim that cultivation is worthless is illegitimate. He inherited a nurtured opportunity.

### Square Deal Recommendation

**Structural principle:** Commission should be split proportional to effort and contribution, with recognition that Alice could not have controlled her absence.

**Immediate resolution:**
- Alice: 65% of commission
- Bob: 35% of commission

**Rationale:**
- 6 months of cultivation vs. final close suggests Alice's contribution was larger in time and effort
- But Bob's work was essential—no close, no revenue
- Alice's medical leave was involuntary; penalizing her fully would be crooked
- Bob took on a deal in progress; he knew the context
- 65/35 reflects the preponderance of effort while recognizing both contributions

**Ongoing monitoring:**
- Establish explicit "deals in progress" policy for leaves of absence
- Require handoff documentation so successors know they're inheriting, not originating
- Define cultivation vs. closing contribution weightings in advance

### For Each Party

**Alice:**
- Receives: 65% of commission
- Must accept: She did not close the deal; some credit to Bob is fair
- Why this is square: Her 6 months of work is recognized; her involuntary absence is not held against her

**Bob:**
- Receives: 35% of commission
- Must accept: He inherited a cultivated opportunity; he did not create it from nothing
- Why this is square: His closing work is recognized; he is not treated as though he contributed nothing

**Both:**
- The split may not match what either wanted, but it matches what each contributed
- Neither is punished for circumstances; both are rewarded for effort
- The dealing is straight

### The Honest Dealing Principle
A square deal does not guarantee anyone the outcome they want. It guarantees that the dealing is honest—no crookedness, no favoritism, no punishment of legitimate contribution. Both Alice and Bob contributed to this revenue. Both receive proportional credit. Neither receives the other's share. That is the square deal.
